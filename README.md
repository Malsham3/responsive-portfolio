# responsive-portfolio


In this project, the goal is to efficently build a responsive portfolio site using Bootstrap, which is a CSS frameworks that give us access to common styling templates. In Bootstrap, we utilize the use of the grid system which gives our webpage the layout of rows and columns. content is added in columns which are contained in rows. The final result should be viewable appropriately in different screens (992, 768, 400). Below is a description of content of each page. 
Note: all pages contain a fixed navigation bar with links to other pages (Contact, Portfolio, About) and a sticky footer with  a message as a bonus.
